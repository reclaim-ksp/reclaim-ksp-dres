# Reclaim KSP // Dres

This mod ~~replaces~~ adds Dres, the urban legend referenced in KSP 1 memes, based on testimony from the victims of the mass hallucination called "KSP 2".

Features:
- the rings
- similar terrain as described in the collective hallucination
- with colors adjusted for less jaundice and to be more fitting for something that actually exists!
